# REACT EVENT HANDLER AND FORM CHALLENGE

<p>The first step in this challenge is to display a full list of the Profiles in the state. If you get stuck, think about how we can create new arrays from exisiting arrays with a high order method.</p>

<p>Once you are able to see all of the profiles as a list, you new task is to create a form. This form needs to have three inputs: First Name, Last Name, and Role. When you press a submit button in the form, the values should be used to create a new profile that will add itself to the state, which will render on the screen because of what we did in the first step. A big hint is to target the ID of an input, aka event.currentTarget[yourIDHere].value</p>
